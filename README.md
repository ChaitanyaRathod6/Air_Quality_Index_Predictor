Certainly! Below is the content of the `README.md` file for your **Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor**. You can create this file in your project folder and use it for documentation purposes.

# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction App

This is a web-based application developed using Flask that predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on environmental data. The app utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model to predict AQI values, which can be displayed in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Predict AQI**: Upload environmental data in CSV format to predict the AQI using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: A simple and easy-to-use interface powered by Flask.
- **Model Integration**: The app uses a machine learning model (trained on air quality data) to make predictions.

## Requirements

- **Python**: Version 3.x
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis library, used for reading and processing CSV files.
- **Joblib**: A tool for serializing Python objects (used for saving and loading the trained machine learning model).
- **XGBoost** (optional): If using an XGBoost model, ensure it’s installed.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aqi-prediction.git
cd aqi-prediction
```

### Step 2: Set up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create a virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install the Required Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not provided, you can manually install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install Flask pandas joblib xgboost
```

### Step 4: Place the Required Files

Ensure that the following files are present in the project directory:

- **`aqi_XGBreg_model (1).pkl`**: This is the pre-trained machine learning model used to predict AQI.
- **`real_2018.csv`**: A sample input CSV file containing environmental data to test the model.

### Step 5: Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, and the necessary files are in place, you can run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the app will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

1. **Home Page**: Navigate to the home page of the app (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`). On the home page, you'll see an option to upload a CSV file containing environmental data.
2. **CSV File**: Prepare a CSV file with environmental data that contains the required features for prediction. You can upload the file via the form on the web page.
3. **Prediction**: Once the CSV file is uploaded, the model will process the data and predict the AQI. The results will be displayed on a separate page.

### Sample CSV Format

Here’s an example of what the CSV file should look like. Ensure that the CSV file includes columns like **Temperature**, **Humidity**, **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **CO**, and **NO2** (or similar features):

| Temperature | Humidity | PM2.5 | PM10 | CO  | NO2 |
|-------------|----------|-------|------|-----|-----|
| 28.5        | 60       | 35.5  | 60   | 0.2 | 25  |
| 30.0        | 55       | 45.0  | 50   | 0.3 | 20  |

Each row represents a set of environmental measurements for prediction.

### Example Output

After submitting a CSV file, the application will return the predicted AQI values for each row in the file. Example output:

```
Prediction: [45.0, 56.3, 32.1]
```

These values represent the predicted AQI for each corresponding row in the uploaded CSV file.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model Not Loaded**: If you receive an error that the model is not loaded, make sure the file `aqi_XGBreg_model (1).pkl` is located in the project directory.
- **CSV File Not Found**: Ensure that the `real_2018.csv` file is uploaded correctly, and the data follows the expected format.
- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter an error related to missing libraries, make sure you've installed all the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
